// 1. state the problem, ask for clarification, make sure you know what you're doing

//2.
// input:
// output:

// start at the Head
// find the insertion points

// have two points, - previous and current
//compare if current < item
//move the two points until i find my insertion point
//when I find my insertion point, make new node
//attach the new node to the part i want it to be the head of
//previous points nodewill also point to the new node

//now write the function 3.
function insertIntoList(SLL, item) {
  let previous,
    current = this.head;
  if (SLL.head === null || SLL > item) {
  }
}

//if binary tree, draw the tree, etc..

//if queue or stack, draw it also. figure out which one is better
//evaluate the time complexity

//can it be made better? how?
